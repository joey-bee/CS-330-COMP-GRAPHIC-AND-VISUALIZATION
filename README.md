What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

How do I approach designing software?

  The first approach I take when designing software is by starting with a pseudocode and seperating the objectves the code is supposed to create and generate. When I approach the software design process, it is important for me to follow a systematic process that has proven to work countless times before me. First I look at the main objectives and begin a frame or a pseudo code for the overall project from start to finish. First, I need to gather the users needs and then analyze the problem witin existance, if applicable, and then define the objectives if they cleared, or cleared, at all.

  Before this course took place, it was safe to say that the user experience and disend wasn't my top priority. 

  Either way, the best route was to follow the instructions layed out for us users at the beginning of each week and go as the course/assingment were to direct us.The best route to approach is a "step by step" type of manner and allow the user to break down the larger type of projects into smaller projects to allow them to "tackle" the little parts each time!

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  I think the best way to explain the process I followed was to verbally mention I followed the course moduels as well as directions when creating each step of the 3D scene that was required when rendering the object, lighting and even the texture. The best way to explain how I accomplished it was to express breaking down the larger parts into smaller ones and just "knocking them out" each step at a time. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  I think the development strategies I used while tyring to develop this scene was ways to incorpproate certain libraries. This was much easier than trying to create those from scratch. Another way to look at it daily was to realize it was already in existance with another human deciphering it as well as moving forward with all those points involved. It was a much harder process to process than anticipated. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
  The best route for this was to secect suitbale staragies and debelopments. It was smartest ot choose apropriate strategeis based on the program and could include modular programmig as well as development methodologies. 

  Computational graphics as well as the visualizations have been able to allow me to see the knowledge of how to work with the existing libraries and formulas as well as code from the beginning. Since then, I have been able to understand the other things such as graphics, color and even the space within those realms. 

The study of computer science is going to help m within the areas of problem solving as well as many other domains. Having the ability to be able to break down the complex domains as well as analyze the problems and develop the solution is essential wihtin the professional contexts. Comter sceience and software desing can provide me with a strong enough foundation as well as valuable tools to be able to succeed in reaching my overall goals wether its with the edeucational sorts or professional!
